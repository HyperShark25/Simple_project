When connecting with postgresql.
when we go to settings.py file and go to DATABASES:
We type     'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',      instead of 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'
        'NAME': 'Beta',         Name refers to name of database
        'USER': 'postgres',     refers to the file that is directly under the database file name we did in the
                                last step.
        'PASSWORD': 'dragonballz',      refers to the password we did in the very first time(not the master
                                        password)
        'HOST': 'localhost',        default host
        'PORT': '5432'      default port

In order to deal with the password we need to click on the server we created(PostgreSQL 14) and then
select object and then select change password.
    [ This will change the Password that is needed in settings.py file ]
